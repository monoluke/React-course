1. Your task is to build a course for learning a material that you choose (you can choose anything you like)
2. Since each students has its personal way of learning and understanding the material you should give each students the option to choose the way he wants:
Textual - by articles and tables with relevant data about the subjects
Images - by image and short description that explain the subjects
Videos - with explanation text
Audio - with explanation text
3. Each type should have its own page which will contain all the content to learn (3 pieces of content on each page)
4. Click on a piece of content will link to the content page itself which will contain the whole material
5. The website should have an home page where the user choose from a list of boxes (each box is the content type + image about it) and it will take him to the relevant contents page
6. The website has a menu in all the pages with links: text, images, videos and audio. Each one will link the relevant page of content also
7. Use all the best practices you learned : tags, attributes, security.
8. Bonus for advanced coders (iframe)
- Add a content to learn from another website inside you website
Videos
Images
Texts or whole pages from other websites
- Make sure the content you use is secured and can use only the relevant stuff it needs to do
