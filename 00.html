		<p>The Stormlight Archive is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson. Planned as a ten book series, the first novel, The Way of Kings, was published on August 31, 2010.[1] As of 2020, the series consists of four published novels and two novellas.</p>
		<p>Sanderson completed the first draft of The Way of Kings in 2003, though the original manuscript differed significantly from the published text. Sanderson referred to the prospective series as The Oathshards Series in 2004.[2] The first draft of the manuscript was among over a dozen books written before his debut publication Elantris (2005).[3] The book was substantially rewritten between then and its 2010 publication. Six chapters of this early version were included in the anthology Altered Perceptions (2014).[4] The original version of the book is available on the author's official website.[5]</p>
		<p><strong>From June to August 2010, Tor Books published sample chapters from The Way of Kings on its official website, along with an introduction by Sanderson.[6] In its first week of release, The Way of Kings was No. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[7] In subsequent weeks the book was No. 11,[8] No. 20,[9] and No. 25.[10]</strong></p>
